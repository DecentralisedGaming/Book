# Decentralised Gaming Book

The goal of this book is to serve as a useful source of information on decentralied blockchain gaming. The content is for developers, although the first section should be intelligible by non-technical readers.

The ultimate goal is to encourage the production of complex online games that have the same complexity as games we already play, but with a decentralised architecture.

The information will serve as a great point of reference for understanding the technology and design decisions required to make decentralised games. The intent is not to provide a guide of how to build a game, but rather to guide the overall strategy of development.

The following list is the proposed structure of the book. Currently, it is a work in progress.
