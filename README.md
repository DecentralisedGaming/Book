# Decentralised Gaming Book

The goal of this book is to serve as a useful source of information on decentralied blockchain gaming. The book will serve as a great point of reference for understanding the technology and design decisions required to make such games, but the intent is not to explain how to actually build a blockchain game.

The following list is the proposed structure of the book. Currently, it is a work in progress.
