# Preface

## Why does this book need to be written?
The goal of this book is to be a useful source of information on blockchain game technology. The intention is to explain how components of the technology work and inform how to make better design decisions, so it should serve as a great point of reference but the intent is not to explain how to actually build a blockchain game.

To date, there isn't a book that covers this specific topic. There is a lack of good design documentation, and the number of technical blogs that go into any detail are fairly minimal. While blogs tend to be great at introducing complex ideas, they are not good as points of reference. It is difficult to remember all points covered in a blog and linking directly to a particular paragraph is impossible.

As this book can be found online in a public space (GitHub) it means that we now have a reference point for specific topics with easy-to-share links.


## Intended Audience
At the start of writing this book, the intention is to write a book for people interested in the development of blockchain games. It is not expected that the reader will be an expert in blockchain technology but familiarity with gaming and blockchain technology will help. This is not a coding book and there is no intention to provide coding tutorials. The book will not get overly technical but there will be areas where having a technical background will aid understanding. 


## Contributing
It feels appropriate that a book dedicated to open-source software should itself be open source. Creating issues and pull requests are welcome as we want this book to be a collaborative effort.

Questions should go into issues and small updates should be put into a pull request. For large insertions or modifications, it would be best to reach out and discuss.

The style of writing that fits best is concise, factual, best to avoid pronouns and specifically not written in first-person singular (i.e. don't use "I / My").
